# Oracle-UDT-Example
An example project for the standard way of using Oracle's UDT in ServForOracle.


Note: It only supports .NET Full Framework and you need to download the native Oracle dependencies from their website [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/odacdeploy-4242173.html).

It's used as an example for the library ServForOracle, you can see a more detailed explanation in this blog post - https://blog.roysanchez.dev/how-to-use-servfororacle/.
